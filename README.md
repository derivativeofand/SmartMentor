## Smart Mentor
Smart Mentor was developed as part of a group project for CS3307, in collaboration with three other team members. It is a multilingual AI tutoring application that leverages the Ollama AI model for dynamic question generation and integrates the MyMemory Translator API for real-time translation, allowing users to interact with the app in their preferred language.

Users can customize quizzes by selecting the subject, difficulty level, and number of questions. The application includes a progress tracker that records quiz results and awards achievements based on performance. It also features a statistics dashboard, which displays detailed insights such as average scores, question accuracy, and progress over time, helping users identify their strengths and areas for improvement.
